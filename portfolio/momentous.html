								<h2>The Challenge</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Finding social and professional events as a student is a difficult process when you factor in other obligations such as tests, meetings and study time. By having a tool that factors the search for events and your unique obligations and filters is missing. The drive for this project was to create an application that combats the fear of missing out while still being studious.</p>

										  <h3>Exisiting Solutions</h3></header>
										  <p>Through our effort to research current solutions we found that they were lacking in certain areas that didn't solve our problem. We also analyzed the strengths and weakness of current solutions so we can learn from them in terms of functionality and usability and possibily incorporate them in our project</p>

							<header>
								<h2>The Proposed Solution</h2>

							</header>
									<p>We have introduced an application that brings exciting events directly to the user’s hands. We wanted the user experience to be fluid and easy to use. We also wanted the user to have the ability of choice. The events would be based on their availability and interests.</p>

								<h3>YOUR CALENDAR + YOUR INTERESTS = LOCAL EVENTS YOU CAN AND WANT TO ATTEND</h3><br>

								<h2>Proposed Tasks</h2>
								<nl>
												<li>View and edit the application's generated calendar to reflect plans.</li>
												<li>Votes to coordinate group activities with other users.</li>
												<li>Look up events that fill empty (negative) spaces in the user's calendar.</li>
												<li>Look up events that fill user-defined free-time (positive) blocks in the user's calendar.</li>
												<li>Export capabilities of the calendar generated by the app to their regular calendar service.</li>
												<li>Ability to find out what other users are attending via a third-party service like facebook.</li>
											</nl><br>


							<h2>User Testing</h2>
							<p>Quick-Up was designed with one primary thing in mind–help the user find and play a game faster. The main functionality of the application is the ability to either join a pick-up game that someone else created or create one that is specific to their needs. When searching to join a game, it considers the distance of the game, when it was created and how many players needed.</p>

											<h3>Methods</h3>

													Investigating how the user perceives the app and how well it meets our goals by having the users talk aloud while navigating the app

													Acting as "a fly on the wall" with each participant. Used to observe a naturalistic use of the application. Answer all questions after each testing process

										<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In summary, my team and I created an application that shows events curated on availability and the user's interests. We did this by investigating potential users and their needs and wants. We discovered that our users want things done quick, easy and well. Our users indicated that they wanted to be notified of new events in their area. Through the process of design thinking, we were able to rapidly iterate on our designs to create a ready to ship product.</p><br>
									<h3>Difficulties Faced</h3>
									<p>Some difficulties we faced were time constraints from the project. Since this was a course project, we only had about 2 weeks to develop the application, reiterate and present. On top of these duties, we were all still full-time students, therefore, had other obligations that sometimes were more pressing. This is where I had a difficult time in understanding my team's strengths and weaknesses in pushing changes to the application. The final difficulty we had was narrowing down what our users thought to be interesting and what exactly they wanted. Interviews and questionnaires can only answer so much, therefore attending to all the issues was a challenge. With all these difficulties we had faced, we ultimately had to cut out certain features that we physically couldn't create in the allotted time.</p><br>
									<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
									<p>Finally, my team and I learned a lot from this project. We learned that iteration is key in good design. We also learned that good ideas come later during the ideation phase. The biggest thing we learned though is about teamwork and working together. Finally, I would like to mention that our teamwork on this project highlighted everyone's strengths and improved everyone's weaknesses. I learned how to be a better leader and organizing details on the project team. I had also learned that if a percentage of the team isn't pulling their own weight, it becomes very difficult for the rest of the team to move forward.</p>
